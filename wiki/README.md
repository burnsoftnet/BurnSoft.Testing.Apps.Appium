# BurnSoft.Testing.Apps.Appium

The BurnSoft.Testing.Apps.Appium library was created to help simplify and speed up the process of creating tests for Desktop based applications.
Currently it is built around testing windows application, but later on can be based on other platforms.

Besides you basick execution functions that this library executes, it also can combine those function to be ran as a batch function to simplify the 
executeion of a test and provide a nice report of what ran ok and what broke.
